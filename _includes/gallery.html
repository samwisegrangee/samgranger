          <p>Davenport University needed a little social network for their DavenFund initiative. Employees submit proposals for funds to make their work environment better. They can also view the proposals submitted by others. Launched February 2017. <br> I'd give you a link, but it's employees only.

          <h3>Madcap Coffee</h3>
          <p>Madcap Coffee is an award-winning roastery located in Grand Rapids, MI. This site was designed by Conduit Studios. I was brought on board with the CurlyHost development team.<br> The majority of my work was developing responsive templates and plugins that were intuitive for both visitors to experience and the client to use. Some of my favorite projects were keeping backgrounds lined up with bag labels, custom gradients, generating related products and slideshows on the fly, and responsively dealing with overflow text.</p>
