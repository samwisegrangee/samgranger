      <p>I'm like my code: clean, logical, and fun to interact with. Having always been a jack of all trades, I bring a holistic vision to web development, one gained through a varied background in photography, illustration, publishing, and film. <br><br>Taking a vision from sketches on paper to pixels on screen is my joy. The problem solving along the way is my creative process. Telling someone's story is why I do it.</p>
