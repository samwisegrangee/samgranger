      <p>I'm like my code: clean, logical, and fun to interact with. Having always been a jack of all trades, I bring a holistic vision to web development, one gained through a varied background in photography, illustration, publishing, and film. <br>Taking a vision from sketches on paper to pixels on screen is my joy. The problem solving along the way is my creative process. Telling someone's story is why I do it.</p>

              Maybe you're starting something new. Or maybe you've been doing something for a long time and you're just now getting around to having your own website. Either way, exciting stuff. Tell me what you're up to and what you're about. I'll build something to match.

              Someone could come across your site on a desktop while a work, while relaxing with their tablet at home, or while scrolling through their phone waiting in line. In fact, you're probably not looking at this on a computer right now.
              Everything I build is responsive to make sure your site looks its best, no matter the device.

              Even if you don't think of yourself a blogger, every site tells a story.
              Building a site with Wordpress's content management system puts control back in your hands.
              I can update your current one, or build you one afresh.
