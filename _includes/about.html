        <h2 class="bumped-h">Hey there</h2>
        <p>My name is Sam Granger. Logic and creativity not only influence my code, they drive my life. I'm a front end web developer whose sites and elements help people tell stories, have insights, and make connections.</p>

        <p>When I'm not working or thinking (or thinking about thinking), I'm usually <a class="click-me" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b98ItgwIcnU" target="_blank"><strong>playing guitar</strong></a>, learning a new language, or  spending time in the woods and waters of my home state of Michigan.</p>

        <p>I'm always looking for new problems to solve, new projects to take on, and new people to meet. So take a look around and <a class="click-me" href="#contact"><strong>drop me a line</strong></a>.</p>
