      <h2>Welcome to my Site</h2>

        <p>
        My name is Sam Granger. I'm a web developer and artist with a knack for bringing people together and making insights happen. In the past I've worked as an editor, teacher, marketer, illustrator, and documentary filmwriter. Now, I'm busy being a code architect, creating spaces on the web for information and interaction. My background in cognition always keeps me "thinking about thinking" and thinking about how beautiful design helps us think better. When I'm not working or thinking, I'm usually <a class="click-me" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b98ItgwIcnU" target="_blank"><strong>playing guitar</strong></a>, learning a new language, or being spending my time in the waters and the woods of my home state of Michigan.
      <br>
      <br>
        I'm always looking for new problems to solve, new projects to take on, and new people to meet. So take a look around and feel free to <a class="click-me" href="#contact"><strong>drop me a line</strong></a>.
