              Maybe you're starting something new. Or maybe you've been doing something for a long time and you're just now getting around to having your own website. Either way, exciting stuff. Tell me what you're up to and what you're about. I'll build something to match.

              Someone could come across your site on a desktop while a work, while relaxing with their tablet at home, or while scrolling through their phone waiting in line. In fact, you're probably not looking at this on a computer right now.
              Everything I build is responsive to make sure your site looks its best, no matter the device.

              Even if you don't think of yourself a blogger, every site tells a story.
              Building a site with Wordpress's content management system puts control back in your hands.
              I can update your current one, or build you one afresh.

        <p>My name is Sam Granger. I'm a front end web developer whose sites and elements help people tell stories, have insights, and make connections.</p>

        <p>When I'm not working or thinking (or thinking about thinking), I'm usually playing guitar, learning a new language, or spending time in the woods and waters of my home state of Michigan.</p>

        <p>I'm always looking for new problems to solve, new projects to take on, and new people to meet. So take a look around and let's <a class="click-me" href="#contact"><strong>get in touch.</strong></a></p>
